Robotics Project Two
This project is the second of a two-part series of mini projects, involving the use of ROS.
- Use the bag provided to create a map of the environment
- Setup a realistic simulation of the robot using real robot data and the map created (using stage)
- Robot data available here: https://global.agilex.ai/products/scout-mini
- Setup the navigation stack to receive goals and move the simulated robot avoiding obstacles in the generated map
- Write a goal-publisher node that reads a sequence of goals from a csv and send them to the robot. A new goal is sent when the robot reach the previous one or itâ€™s aborted
